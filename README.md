# Password Strength Indicator Project
This project implements a password strength indicator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with real-time feedback on the strength of their entered password, helping them create more secure passwords.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>Password Strength Detection</h3>
<h4>Real-Time Feedback</h4>
As users type their password into the input field, the application analyzes the length of the password and provides instant feedback on its strength, categorized as "weak", "medium", or "strong". This feedback helps users understand the security level of their password. 
<h4>Visual Indicators</h4>
The password strength is visually represented by changing the border color of the input field and the color of the feedback message. Weak passwords are indicated by a red border, medium by a yellow border, and strong passwords by a green border. 
<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
<h3>HTML Structure</h3>
The HTML consists of a container that holds the password input field, a submit button, and a feedback message. The input field is of type `password`, ensuring that the text is obscured. The feedback message is dynamically updated based on the user's input. 
<h3>CSS Styling</h3>
<h4>Layout and Design</h4>
The project uses a minimalistic design with a dark background, white text, and a modern, clean layout. The input field is styled with a transparent background and white placeholder text, aligning with the overall aesthetic. 
<h4>Dynamic Styling</h4>
CSS is used to dynamically change the border and text color of the input field and message based on the password's strength. This provides a clear visual cue to the user. 
<h3>JavaScript Functionality</h3>
<h4>Password Analysis</h4>
JavaScript is used to monitor the user's input and evaluate the password's length. Based on the length, the script classifies the password into three categories — weak, medium, and strong — and updates the interface accordingly.

    pass.addEventListener('input', () => {
      // Function implementation
    }

<h2>In Summary</h2>
This password strength indicator project provides an essential tool for enhancing password security. It offers real-time feedback, helping users create stronger passwords by clearly indicating their password's strength. The project is built using simple and effective techniques in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a great foundation for further development or integration into larger projects.
